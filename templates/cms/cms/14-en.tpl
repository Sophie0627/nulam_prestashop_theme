                                                switch from your current food to
                                                NULAM&nbsp;</span></p>
                                        <p>Because your current food is most likely an extruded product (if put in
                                            water it floats)and Nulam chunks a pressed product (in water it drops to
                                            the bottom), therefore we advise you strongly not to mix Nulam chunks
                                            with your current food. The difference between the pressed Nulam product
                                            and an extruded product is not only in composition but also in the
                                            overall digestion process. The extruded food sucks itself full in the
                                            stomach of the dog, floats, expands and falls apart. Nulam however,
                                            falls apart slowly and settles at the bottom of the stomach.</p>

                                                method</span></p>
                                        <p style="font-size: 12pt;">This is the most safe and health-enhancing
                                            method, which we also advise if the dog often has loose stools or
                                            diarrhea. Loose stools is usually a sign that the intestinal flora is in
                                            need of a "maintenance" and needs to be rebuilt before Nulam shall be
                                            tolerated by the dog. When you finish your current dry food, you can
                                            start with giving the dog at least 5 days in succession just Nulam
                                            Fresh, Pure Tripe. You should give the "fresh meat" (after defrosting)
                                            at room temperature. Nulam Fresh should not be defrosted in the
                                            microwave because the microwave destroys all the good ingredients
                                            (including the much needed bacteria) of the fresh meat. After these 5
                                            days "fresh meat" you can start giving Nulam to the dog. Then follow
                                            directions as described in our dietary-advice</p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 600;"> Second method</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;"><span
                                                    style="color: #808080;">This method we recommend for dogs that
                                                    have problems with their digestion. When you finish your current
                                                    dry food, you can start the first day giving the dog Nulam
                                                    Fresh, Pure Tripe Complete. Defrost the "fresh meat" at room
                                                    temperature and immerse it a short period in just boiled hot
                                                    water. Let cool before giving it to the dog! Divide the "fresh
                                                    meat" in several (at least 4) meals per day. The more small
                                                    meals the dog gets to eat, the better the digestion and
                                                    intestinal tolerance. The 2nd or 3rd day you should give the
                                                    "fresh meat" spread over several meals a day. When the stools
                                                    have been of good quality for several days you can start with
                                                    mixing a little Nulam through the "fresh meat". Then you
                                                    gradually replace more and more "fresh meat" with Nulam. The 7th
                                                    day you replace half of the "fresh meat" for Nulam and on the
                                                    8th day you just provide Nulam to the dog.</span> </span></p>

                                                    style="color: #808080;">If Nulam Fresh Pure Tripe Complete is
                                                    hard to purchase in your area you can also change 25% of each
                                                    meal (5 times a day) of Nulam with the double amount of raw
                                                    unwashed tripe. You need to do this until the stools are at
                                                    least 1 full week of good quality. Once the stools are good for
                                                    a week you can start to reduce slowly the amount of tripe.
                                                    However you need to keep adding raw unwashed tripe to the dry
                                                    food on a regular basis in order to keep the intestinal flora in
                                                    good condition. The ratio of Nulam Fresh vs. Nulam is about 2:1.
                                                    So 200 grams of Nulam Fresh is approximately equal to 100 grams
                                                    Nulam. This is a directive that applies only to Nulam Fresh

                                                    satisfied with the stools of your dog, remember that this is an
                                                    indication that the intestinal flora is not in the desirable
                                                    condition. Simply put, it means more help to rebuild the
                                                    intestinal flora is needed. Replace (at each meal) for a long
                                                    time 20% of Nulam by Nulam Fresh Pure Tripe or give a week-long
